# JsValue Core Runtime Values

When working inside the core engine, keep JavaScript values represented as
`JsValue` until an explicitly intentional boundary requires another shape.

## Rules

1. Do not introduce new `object?` helper parameters, return values, or local
   conversion bridges for JavaScript values in parser, AST, optimizer,
   bytecode, IR, evaluator, or runtime helper code.
2. Preserve `object?` only at intentional boundaries such as public facade APIs,
   host interop surfaces, debugger/diagnostic projections, or CLR object
   conversion helpers.
3. When migrating legacy `object?` helper clusters, move the whole private
   helper flow to `JsValue` first, then delete obsolete bridge helpers such as
   `ToJsValue`, `ToObject`, or `FromObjectUnsafe` round trips that are no
   longer needed.
4. Use shared `JsValue`/`JsOps` operations for JavaScript coercions, equality,
   truthiness, and string conversion instead of recreating object-pattern
   coercion switches.
5. Keep the proof scoped to the migrated cluster: capture a targeted baseline
   search for the legacy signatures, rerun the matching search after the edit,
   and pair it with focused tests that cover the affected semantics.

## Why

Issue `autrun-diqzx0r7ibgg-35b8604f32` / PR #1697 migrated
`TypedConstantExpressionTransformer` constant-fold helpers from `object?` to
`JsValue`. The old flow extracted literals into CLR objects, folded through
object-pattern coercion helpers, then converted folded results back to
`JsValue`. That made a core optimizer path violate the engine value-primitive
contract and kept boxing/conversion bridges alive in code that already had
`JsValue` literals. Future object-to-`JsValue` migrations should preserve
intentional public/interop boundaries, but core helper clusters should stay
`JsValue`-native end to end.
