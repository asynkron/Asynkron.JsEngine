# Performance Profiling Guardrails

When planning or implementing performance work, start from profiles that isolate
the target cost instead of reading a broad benchmark as proof of the next
optimization.

## Rules

1. For function-call activation overhead, use the activation profiles in
   `tools/profile-manifest.json` and `tools/performance-profiler.sh`:
   `activation-noargs`, `activation-params`, `activation-arguments`,
   `activation-closures`, and `activation-evalscope`.
2. Keep CPU and memory evidence separate. A CPU hotspot in call entry does not
   prove an allocation win, and an allocation type table does not prove exact
   allocation provenance without a call tree.
3. Preserve `PERF_PROFILES` override behavior when changing aggregate profiler
   defaults. Default guardrails may expand, but operators must still be able to
   run a narrowed profile set.
4. Keep activation guardrails as profiler/tooling surfaces unless the issue
   explicitly asks for runtime optimization. Do not modify invoker,
   environment, arguments-object, or parameter-binding code without current
   activation-profile evidence.
5. When reporting activation findings, name the owner surface being measured:
   environment/context creation, arguments object creation, parameter binding,
   slot growth, closure capture, eval-sensitive scope behavior, or invoker
   overhead.

## Why

Issue
`planitem-planmanual1779530433702731000-reduce-function-call-activation-overhead-p-d4fdf29166`
and PR #1635 added activation-focused profiling guardrails after the
investigation separated tooling from runtime optimization. The durable lesson is
that activation work needs profiles shaped around activation variants before an
agent can safely claim a function-call optimization target or regression.

Without this rule, future performance agents can overread generic
`functioncalls` or `forloop` profiles, mix CPU and memory conclusions, or edit
runtime activation code before proving which activation owner is actually hot.
