# Unified Bytecode Prototypes

When extending the unified bytecode prototype, keep it IR-owned, internal, and
all-or-nothing until a separate routing issue proves production readiness.

## Rules

1. Use `ExecutionPlan` as the prototype compiler input. Do not create a
   parallel AST-to-unified-bytecode compiler for shapes that the current IR
   already lowers and annotates.
2. Keep eligibility at compile time, including function kind. Unsupported
   statement shapes, expression ops, identifiers, async/generator functions,
   local/declaration forms outside the exact accepted slice, control flow
   outside the acyclic branch slice, or dynamic shapes must return an
   unsupported reason before VM execution.
   Do not infer sync-only eligibility from `ExecutionPlan` shape alone.
3. Do not add fallback inside `UnifiedBytecodeVirtualMachine` to
   `ExpressionProgram` evaluation, AST evaluation, or `ExecutionPlanRunner`.
   VM execution should only execute bytecode the unified compiler emitted.
4. Do not route normal production execution through the unified VM in a
   prototype-expansion issue. Runtime routing needs its own issue and proof
   pack.
5. When expanding linear declaration/return packs, flatten only the supported
   `ExpressionProgram` operations into unified instructions. Identifier reads
   should become `LoadSlot`, literals should become program-owned
   `LoadLiteral` entries, and binary operators should stay limited to the
   explicitly proven numeric VM surface. Do not introduce an
   `EvalExpressionProgram` opcode or a runtime callback into the existing
   expression interpreter.
6. For each accepted shape, add focused tests for the emitted unified opcode
   stream, a minimal execution result, and at least one nearby unsupported
   shape that declines cleanly. When an accepted body shape can also appear in
   async or generator functions, include function-kind negative tests.
7. Keep JavaScript semantic claims narrow. A prototype op such as numeric
   `Add` proves only the tested VM behavior; full JavaScript operator coercion
   requires an explicit migration and parity proof.
8. When expanding across branch/control flow, keep the accepted CFG acyclic and
   compiler-owned. Pre-scan reachable IR instructions for cycles, compile with
   an IR-instruction-index to unified-bytecode-PC map, patch forward branch and
   jump operands after targets are emitted, and reject loops or unsupported
   branch payloads before VM execution. Do not treat acyclic branch support as
   loop support or as permission to call back into existing evaluators.

## Why

Issue #2118 / PR #2137 introduced the first unified bytecode slice for
`function add(x, y) { return x + y; }`. The useful decision was not just the
new files; it was the boundary: compile from existing `ExecutionPlan`, flatten
only the proven return-expression payload, keep the VM fallback-free, and leave
production routing untouched. Future agents should preserve that boundary so
unified-bytecode coverage gaps stay explicit instead of being masked by the
existing statement IR, expression bytecode, or AST evaluators.

Issue #2139 / PR #2144 expanded the prototype to an exact linear local
declaration plus return shape and then fixed review feedback by passing
function-kind metadata into `UnifiedBytecodeCompiler.TryCompile`. The lesson is
that async and generator bodies can look shape-compatible while requiring
promise, iterator, and suspension semantics that the current unified VM does
not implement. Function kind must stay part of the compile-time eligibility
contract.

Issue #2158 / PR #2162 expanded the same prototype into a small linear sync
expression pack with multiple declarations, literals, and numeric binary
operators. The lesson is that this expansion must still own the bytecode it
executes: literals belong in `UnifiedBytecodeProgram`, supported expression ops
are flattened into unified instructions, and unsupported statements or
expression ops decline before execution. Adding a generic expression-program
eval opcode would hide coverage gaps and make the fallback-free VM boundary
untrue.

Issue #2166 / PR #2173 crossed the prototype from linear body walking into
acyclic branch CFG compilation. The lesson is that branch support needs an
explicit bytecode-PC owner: map IR instruction indices to emitted PCs, patch
`JumpIfFalse` and `Jump` targets after blocks are emitted, and reject
loop-shaped graphs before unsupported body details hide the real boundary. This
keeps branch joins, local updates, and condition bytecode owned by the unified
compiler without implying loop support or production routing.
