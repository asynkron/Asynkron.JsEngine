# Asynkron.JsEngine Roadmap

## Purpose
This roadmap aligns near-term implementation work with the long-term goal of building a strong Node.js competitor on .NET, while staying explicit about what is currently proven versus what is still directional.

## Current State (2026-05-23)

### What Works Well
- The engine has a clear fast-path direction: typed AST parse/analyze, lowered statement IR, and expression payloads compiled into `ExpressionProgram` bytecode.
- Expression bytecode coverage and failure-code taxonomy are documented and test-linked (`docs/expression-bytecode-coverage.md`).
- Recent migration reporting keeps runtime/storage boundaries explicit and avoids overclaiming execution-path changes (`docs/expression-bytecode-migration-report-2026-05-23.md`).

### What Works Worse
- Statement execution still relies on record-backed `ExecutionPlan.Instructions`; compact statement storage is diagnostics-oriented rather than runtime-active today.
- Unsupported statement-family buckets remain in migration diagnostics, so compact runtime-routing and record-backed removal are not yet low-risk.
- Dynamic/eval seams and activation-sensitive behavior still require careful handling to avoid correctness regressions while optimizing hot paths.

### What Could Improve Next
- Continue lowering-time normalization in the unsupported statement families so more instruction shapes become execution-ready without mixed AST/IR fallback seams.
- Keep removing allocation-heavy or indirect hot-path seams before broader storage/routing flips.
- Strengthen recurring evidence loops (focused diagnostics, seam scans, memory checks) so optimization progress is measurable and comparable across runs.

## Short-Term Goals
1. Burn down unsupported statement instruction families identified by current storage diagnostics.
2. Keep expression-bytecode coverage maps and failure buckets in sync with compiler behavior and representative tests.
3. Preserve runtime truth boundaries while improving compact storage readiness (no premature claim that compact storage is the runtime contract).
4. Track activation/eval-sensitive changes with narrow, repeatable proof packs before broadening to larger sweeps.

## Long-Term Goals
1. Raise and sustain Test262 compatibility toward full compliance through spec-owned, subsystem-driven slices.
2. Reach Node.js-competitive runtime behavior and developer ergonomics on .NET, including module/runtime compatibility and predictable host integration seams.
3. Improve performance tracking discipline (CPU/allocation benchmarks and profile trends) so speed/memory work remains evidence-driven over time.
4. Land compact statement-bytecode execution paths only when unsupported-family and parity evidence show safe readiness.

## Evidence Surfaces
- Current migration direction and runtime/storage boundary: `docs/expression-bytecode-migration-report-2026-05-23.md`
- Expression bytecode capability and failure taxonomy: `docs/expression-bytecode-coverage.md`
- Historical Test262 gap inventory (not a current pass/fail baseline): `docs/remaining-test262-gaps.md`
- Active diagnostics/runtime implementation surfaces:
  - `src/Asynkron.JsEngine/Execution/StatementInstructionStorageDiagnostics.cs`
  - `src/Asynkron.JsEngine/Execution/StatementInstructionDiagnosticsCodec.cs`

## Baseline Notes
- Historical Test262 counts in `docs/remaining-test262-gaps.md` are directional context only and must not be treated as current regression results.
- This roadmap is a documentation slice and does not itself assert new runtime behavior.
